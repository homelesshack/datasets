Monthly rental payments can then be made directly to a landlord by means of a housing benefit claim. The deposit or guarantee will last for the duration of the first six months and a maximum of twelve months. During this time the tenant is expected to demonstrate that they have been able to manage a tenancy and save towards the actual cost of the bond.",

      "info": "Emmaus communities are not hostels for the homeless; they provide a home for as long as someone needs it. For many, this support and stability is like being part of a family, providing a safe, caring and understanding place in which to settle and re-build their lives. Often this is an opportunity to overcome issues such as addiction, get support with mental health issues or rebuild relationships with family and friends. &#10;&#10;Emmaus Mossley offers you a home, work in a social enterprise and an opportunity for you to gain confidence, training and any support you may need to live independently. To join an Emmaus community you have to commit to working full-time in the social enterprise but the rewards for doing so are great. &#10;&#10;There are many benefits to joining an Emmaus Mossley. Help is available in things you wish to change in your life. This can cover anything &ndash; from personal development, training, career development, and housing support to help with drug or alcohol dependency, mental health and physical wellbeing. The Emmaus Mossley community is a drug and alcohol free environment.",
