It runs for 20 weeks and allows participants to gain work skills and experience within the six main areas of our operation: warehousing &amp;amp; deliveries, catering, customer services, facilities management, waste recycling and office admin. Further support is provided through our own in-house training modules.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Freedom Project participants can access a number of other services alongside their work experience. Some of these are support-related, such as professional counselling and mentoring. Others are creative like our art and drama classes. Finally there are employability-based services such as our Ready for Work club and work placements with local businesses.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Freedom Project regularly helps its participants to grow in confidence, motivation, stability, wellbeing and employability. It ensures that they have an up-to-date CV and gives them at least one current work reference. Perhaps most important of all, it provides the opportunity to experience the sense of value that comes from belonging to a healthy community and from serving others in need.",
