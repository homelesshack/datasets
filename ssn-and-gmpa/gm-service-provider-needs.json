Our Creative Programmes Manager Graham initially came up with the idea of fusing nature and city life together and with the support of the pupils, teachers and our Freedom Project participants, pictures of trees were drawn in class and at Mustard Tree which were transferred onto large wooden boards. In addition to this, Graham talked to pupils about the importance of the environment, what trees do and why they are vital to every living creature on the planet. In total, 34 trees have been placed on the fences of the New Islington Free School which we hope will give Ancoats a fresh identity and encourage community spirit. &#10;&#10;We would like to frame the original art work produced by the the children and present each one to the children after exhibiting them both at Mustard Tree and at the school.
