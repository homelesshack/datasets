Some people who have served in the armed forces say that they can experience emotional difficulties and find it hard to ask for help. This may be because of difficult experiences or simply adjusting to civilian life. Pennine Care previously delivered the service across the North West as part of a pilot and has so far helped over 1,000 veterans with a range of mental health problems. To get support you can call us on 0300 323 0707 or fill in the simple online referral form on our site; https://www.penninecare.nhs.uk/your-services/military-veterans-service/",
